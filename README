ISO Codes
---------

Dan Webb (dan@massiverobot.co.uk)

Small and simple Ruby gem that allows you to look up and list ISO codes for
countries, languages and currencies.

Each part of the library is lazily loaded so you only load the data you use.
If you'd like to add any other useful ISO code lookups then feel free to fork.

Source data from: http://www.commondatahub.com/ and will be kept up to date 
periodically.

Usage
-----

require 'rubygems'
require 'iso_codes'

Language.all #=> An array of all language objects (for filling form selects etc)
Language.find_by_a2('en') #=> find the language with the 2 character code 'en'

Country.find_all_by_region('Europe') #=> returns all countries in Europe

Currency.find_by_country('GB') #=> returns Currency representing GBP
